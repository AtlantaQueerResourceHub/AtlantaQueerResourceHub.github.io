            <p>
                Getting Gender Affirming Care in the state of Georgia is a lot easier than you'd think if you have health insurance. The cost is as much as seeing a regular doctor plus blood work, and the medication comes out to an average of $25/month for most people. Assuming this path works for you, there are a variety of sources in the Metropolitan Atlanta area for you to choose from.<br>
                What you are looking for is called <b>Informed consent gender affirming care</b>. Informed consent means you don't need a psychiatric evaluation first, you just need to understand the risks involved. This is paperwork your doctor will give you that will list the 'side effects' of the medication. many offices around Atlanta follow this procedure at the time of writing (Nov '24)

                Avitacare is an in person clinic that many trans people at KSU use for their care. They are a primary care first, meaning they are also just a doctors office. Avitacare has proved it's alliance with the community by sponsoring many pride events including Southern Fried Queer Pride and their team will be very friendly and accommodating.<br>
                When you call to make an appointment, say "I'd like to make an appointment for gender affirming care" and the receptionist will help you from there.

                    My experience with Avitacare has been above what i had expected, Not only do they provide gender affirming care, but i also had psychological and other care there as well. THe team is very professional and easy to talk too. They make the entire process easy to manage and take your feedback seriously. Everything is done in house so all you have to do is show up to appointments. They do opperate like any normal doctor's office and i believe they charge insurance as a doctor's visit, so see how much you pay per doctor's visit on your insurance plan.

                    my experience with qmed was extremely pleasant. the process of booking appointments, verifying insurance, and actually getting HRT were all very easy. the doctor i chose (dr. al samach) very clearly explained side effects, lab work, prescription options, and timelines, and i got a prescription the same day. it was one of the best (if not the best) experiences iâ€™ve ever had with any sort of medical practice. if you're looking for a good place to get HRT, live in one of their covered states, and either have in network insurance or are willing to pay the subscription fee, i would highly recommend it!
