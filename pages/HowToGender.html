                    <b>General Rule:</b>
                    In general, men's sizes run larger than women's. To convert a men's shirt size to a women's size, subtract about 1.5 to 2 sizes. For example, if you typically wear a men's size Medium, you would likely fit into a women's size Large.<br><br>

                    Men's XS = Women's S<br>
                    Men's S = Women's M<br>
                    Men's M = Women's L<br>
                    Men's L = Women's XL<br>
                </p>

                    <b>General Rule:</b><br>
                    The most noticeable difference between men's and women's pants sizes is how they are measured. Men's pants are typically labeled by waist size and inseam (length) (e.g., 32Ã—32), while women's sizes follow a number system (e.g., 8, 10, 12). To convert men's waist sizes to women's, subtract roughly 21 inches. For instance, a men's size 32 waist would roughly correspond to a women's size 10.<br><br>

                    Men's 30 waist = Women's 8<br>
                    Men's 32 waist = Women's 10<br>
                    Men's 34 waist = Women's 12<br>
                    Men's 36 waist = Women's 14<br>
